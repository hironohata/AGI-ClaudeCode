# Shiori adds bookmarks to PDF files that do not already contain bookmarks.


## PDF Format

Shiori assumes that the target PDF file follows the structure below and searches for these heading patterns to create hierarchical bookmarks.

```text
H1 1. [Title text]
H2 1.1 [Title text]
H3 1.1.1 [Title text]
H4 (1) [Title text]
H5 (a) [Title text]
```

- H1 headings must start at the first column of a line.
- H2 and lower-level headings may start at the first or any subsequent column.
